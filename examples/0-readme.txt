0-p-calculators

Calculate the pressure for a given temperature and unit cell volume across a range of P-V-T equations of state. The materials available include Au, Pt, MgO, NaCl, NaCl-B2, and Ne. One notable feature is the calculation of uncertainties in the pressure, which are based on the uncertainties of EOS parameters, temperature, and volume using appropriate error propagation methods.

1-eos-uncertainty-calculation

Show a range of examples for properly propagating error bars using Pytheos. The examples provided illustrate error propagation for pressure and bulk modulus calculations.

2-bm3-to-vinet-conversion

Demonstrate how the bulk modulus and the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus obtained from the Birch-Murnaghan equation can be converted into values for the Vinet equation to produce the same outcome using Pytheos.

6-pressure-scale-test

Test the reproducibility of the scales in Pytheos in comparison with the pressure calculations presented in the papers. Note that some table values in the literature are difficult to reproduce, likely due to truncation of the presented equation of state parameter values and even potential errors in calculation.

7-11-eos-fit

Show how to conduct a fitting of data for the pressure-volume equation of state or the pressure-volume-temperature equation of state. The examples focus particularly on fitting the equation of state by varying the equations of state from different papers.
