PYTHEOS
=======

|DOI|

Overview
--------

``Pytheos`` provides a tool set for a wide range of tasks in high
pressure science:

-  calculate pressure from a number of built-in pressure scales

-  convert pressure scales

-  propagate uncertainties properly using the ``uncertainties`` package

-  fit pressure-volume and pressure-volume-temperature data sets using
   the ``scipy`` and ``lmfit`` packages

-  fit with a wide range of different equations and their combinations

Install
-------

``Pytheos`` is a pure python package.

It can be installed from source or,

::

    $ pip install pytheos


Contact
-------

Please contact Dan Shim (shdshim@gmail.com) for bug reports, comments,
and suggestions. I am happy to include new pressure scales or other
pressure scales in ``pytheos`` as well.

Examples and Tutorials
----------------------

The ``pytheos`` package includes examples in Jupyter Notebook (under the
examples folder), which demonstrate a range of operations, calculations,
and fittings you can do with ``pytheos``. ``Pytheos`` is designed to
support data analysis using Jupyter Notebook as well as python scripts.

Documentation is available at: https://shdshim.github.io/pytheos-docs/.
