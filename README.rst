Pythoeos provides a versatile tool set for calculating pressure from number of
built-in pressure scales, converting pressure scales, fitting pressure-volume
and pressure-volume-temperature data to a wide range of equations and their
combinations.

Install
-------

Pythoeos is a pure python package, and can be installed from source or with
``pip install pytheos``.

Anaconda users may try: ``conda install -c shdshim pytheos``.

Contact
-------

You may contact Dan Shim (shdshim@gmail.com) for bug reports, comments, and
suggestions.  I am happy to include your new pressure scales or other pressure
scales as well.

Examples and Tutorials
----------------------

This package includes number of examples in Jupyter Notebook (under examples
folder), which demonstrate a range of operations, calculations, and fittings
you can make with pytheos. In fact, pytheos is designed to support data
analysis using Jupyter Notebook as well as python scripts.
